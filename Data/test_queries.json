Read moreHydroxocobalamin is indicated for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning: Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, Hydroxocobalamin should be administered without delay.In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.Smoke Inhalation: Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Hydroxocobalamin, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following: Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area Presence of soot around the mouth, nose or oropharynx Altered mental status Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes: Caution should be exercised when administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Hydroxocobalamin, as the safety of co-administration has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with Hydroxocobalamin, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous line."

Read moreIloperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.When deciding among the alternative treatments available for this condition, the prescriber should consider the finding that iloperidone is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointestype arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which can result in sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether iloperidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known.Patients must be titrated to an effective dose of iloperidone. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require a similar titration. Prescribers should be mindful of this delay when selecting an antipsychotic drug for the treatment of schizophrenia"

Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body."

In such case, prescribers are advised to issue Artemether and Lumefantrine to be carried by the traveler for self-administration (stand by emergency treatment). Consideration should be given to official guidance regarding the appropriate use of the anti-malarial agents."

A particularly high degree of activity is exhibited against Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli and Proteus spp., making Cotrimoxazole particularly suitable for the treatment of chronic bronchitis and urinary tract infections. Cotrimoxazole exerts its bactericidal action by the sequential blockade of two bacterial enzyme systems in the biosynthesis of Folinic acid in the micro-organisms. The synergy thus produced accounts for the high degree of bactericidal activity.Indications are : Respiratory tract infections, including acute and chronic bronchitis (treatment and prophylaxis), bronchiectasis, lung abscess, lobar and broncho-pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis, sinusitis and otitis media. Genito-urinary tract infections, including urethritis, acute and chronic cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis and gonorrhoea. Gastro-intestinal tract infections, caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, including the chronic carrier state. Other infections, caused by a wide range of organisms confirmed to be susceptible to Cotrimoxazole and where the therapeutic benefits are considered to outweigh the possible occurrence of adverse events.

Read moreHypertension: Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.Lisinopril may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents.Heart Failure: Lisinopril is indicated to reduce signs and symptoms of heart failure in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis.Acute Myocardial Infarction: Lisinopril is indicated for the reduction of mortality in treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and beta-blockers"

Read moreHydroxocobalamin is indicated for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning: Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, Hydroxocobalamin should be administered without delay.In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.Smoke Inhalation: Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Hydroxocobalamin, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following: Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area Presence of soot around the mouth, nose or oropharynx Altered mental status Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes: Caution should be exercised when administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Hydroxocobalamin, as the safety of co-administration has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with Hydroxocobalamin, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous line."

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium Carbonate is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Calcium Carbonate containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration.1000 mg tablet: This is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach."

Read moreAcromegaly: Octreotide acetate injection is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I (somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses. The goal is to achieve normalization of growth hormone and IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels. In patients with acromegaly, Octreotide acetate injection reduces growth hormone to within normal ranges in 50% of patients and reduces IGF-I (somatomedin C) to within normal ranges in 50% to 60% of patients. Since the effects of pituitary irradiation may not become maximal for several years, adjunctive therapy with Octreotide acetate injection to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I (somatomedin C) offers potential benefit before the effects of irradiation are manifested.Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth were not shown in clinical trials performed with Octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects.Carcinoid Tumors: Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease.Octreotide acetate injection studies were not designed to show an effect on the size, rate of growth or development of metastases.Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas): Octreotide acetate injection is indicated for the treatment of the profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors.

Devil's claw seems to work about as well as some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Osteoarthritis: Taking devil's claw alone or along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to help decrease osteoarthritis-related pain.

Some people taking devil's claw seem to be able to lower the dose of NSAIDs they need for pain relief. This evidence comes from a study that used a specific powdered devil's claw root product (Harpadol, Arkopharma) containing 2% of the devil's claw ingredient harpagoside (9.5 mg/capsule) and 3% total iridoid glycosides (14.5 mg per capsule).
